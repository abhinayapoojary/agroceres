##This repository is built for hack4resilence 2020!!!
##Here the application is built using Django Framework. This application majorly helps the farmers to connect to the market status on cultivation of food crops and 
helps in making decsion on crop cultivation based on maeket demand. It also helps in knowing the market place in the region to get better market values for the crop yield.


#How it works???
There is interface which shows three fields such as crop cultivation, sowing decision maker amd  market status.
To know crop cultivation select state and then the mandal will display the graph which will help in recognising which is the best crop to be grown in that particular area.
When you click on sowing decision will help farmer to know the kind of crop which can be grown in which month and when you click on market status will help you to understand the market price for the particular crop in that region i.e the marketplace with minimum and maximum price for the particular crop.
